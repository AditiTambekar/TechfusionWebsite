                                <strong> What is Java and why is it popular?</strong>
                                <div>
                                  <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent and easy to use. It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>Platform Independence:
                                    Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java highly versatile.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Object-Oriented:
                                      Java’s object-oriented approach allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Key concepts include classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Rich Standard Library:
                                        Java comes with an extensive standard library (Java API) that provides a wide range of ready-to-use utilities for tasks like data structures, networking, input/output, and more.
                                        </p>
                                </div>
                                <strong> What are the main features of Java?
                                </strong>
                                <div>
                                  <p>Platform Independence:
                                    Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability ensures portability across different platforms.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Object-Oriented:
                                      Java is designed around the concepts of objects and classes. It supports key object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>Simple and Easy to Learn:
                                        Java’s syntax is clear and concise, making it easier to learn and use, especially for those familiar with C or C++.</p>
                                        <p>Robust and Secure:
                                          Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors, runtime checking, and automatic garbage collection. Its security features include a bytecode verifier, sandboxing, and the Java security manager to prevent untrusted code from accessing system resources.
                                          </p>

                                <strong>What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?

                                </strong>
                                <div>
                                  <p>Purpose and Use Cases:

                                    Java: A general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used for building a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
                                    JavaScript: A scripting language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web content. It runs in web browsers and is essential for front-end web development.
                                    </p>
                                  <p>Execution Environment:

                                    Java: Requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which the JVM interprets.
                                    JavaScript: Interpreted by web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). JavaScript code is executed directly by the browser’s JavaScript engine.
                                    </p>
                                  <p>Syntax and Language Design:

                                    Java: Strongly typed language with a syntax similar to C++. It requires explicit declaration of variable types.
                                    JavaScript: Loosely typed language with a more flexible syntax. Variables can hold any type of data without explicit type declarations</p>
                                  <p>Object-Oriented Programming:

                                    Java: Class-based object-oriented language. Objects are instances of classes, and inheritance is achieved through class hierarchies.
                                    JavaScript: Prototype-based object-oriented language. Objects can inherit directly from other objects, and functions can be used as constructors.</p>
                                  <p>Concurrency:

                                    Java: Supports multithreading, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently within a program.
                                    JavaScript: Single-threaded with asynchronous event handling. Uses mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling asynchronous operations.</p>
                                  <p>Platform Independence:

                                    Java: "Write once, run anywhere" philosophy. Java applications can run on any device with a JVM.
                                    JavaScript: Runs on any web browser without the need for additional installations. It is inherently cross-platform as long as the browser supports it.</p>
