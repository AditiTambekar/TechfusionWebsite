                                  C++ is an extension of the C programming language that includes object-oriented features. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of complex and reusable code. Key features include classes and objects, templates, and a rich standard library. C++ is widely used in system/software development, game programming, and performance-critical applications.
